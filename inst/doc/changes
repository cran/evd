Changes from Version 1.0-0 are as follows.

  Automated starting values for fitting functions.

  Compiled code is now used within the bivariate fitting routines
  and all bivariate simulation functions.
  They are consequently much faster than those in Version 1.0-0.

  Simulation, distribution, density and fitting functions for the
  bivariate bilogistic, bivariate negative bilogistic and
  bivariate Coles-Tawn models.

  A new function fbvall which fits all bivariate models 
  simultaneously.
  For every model it returns maximum likelihood estimates, standard
  errors, criteria for model comparisons based on the deviance
  (e.g. AIC), and summaries of the dependence structure (see the 
  help file for details).

  A new function abvnonpar which calculates or plots non-parametric
  estimates of the dependence function.

  All functions explicitly allow for missing values.
  This includes bivariate fitting functions, where missing values can
  occur on either or both margins within any observation. 

  Extra argument nsloc for univariate fitting functions,
  and arguments nsloc1 and nsloc2 for bivariate fitting functions.
  These allow non-stationary fitting using linear models for the
  location parameters.

  Extra argument std.err for fitting functions.
  If std.err is FALSE the standard errors are not calculated.
  By default std.err is TRUE.

  Extra argument method for fitting functions.
  The method argument explicitly specifies the optimization method 
  to be passed to the function optim.
  The default method is now BFGS for all fitting functions except 
  fext and forder, where the default method is still Nelder-Mead.
   
  The sealevel data frame has been expanded to include observations 
  from 1912 to 1992. There are 39 missing values.  
   
  Explicit error handling in fitting functions when the observed
  information matrix is singular.  
  
  Artificial constraints are now placed on dependence parameters 
  within bivariate fitting functions to prevent numerical problems.  

  The asy argument for the bivariate asymmetric logistic and 
  bivariate asymmetric negative logistic models now defaults to
  c(1,1).

  The default values of the marginal parameters for the bivariate and
  multivariate functions in Version 1.0-0 are different.
  This is counter intuitive, so the default value for each margin
  within the multivariate functions is now c(0,1,0) (Gumbel), which 
  is consistent with the functions for bivariate models.

  The bivariate density functions contained a fairly minor bug; if one
  of the marginal parameter arguments were passed a three column
  matrix and some of the rows of the matrix produced zero density, a
  fatal error would result.
  This has now been fixed.
