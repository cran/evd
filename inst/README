The evd package extends simulation, distribution, quantile and 
density functions parametric extreme value distributions, and 
provides fitting functions which calculate maximum likelihood 
estimates for univariate and bivariate models.

The users guide (in pdf) will be in the directory evd/doc/  
underneath wherever the package is installed.
It can also be downloaded directly (in postscript or pdf) from 
http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~stephena/.

The evd/doc/ directory also contains a `changes' file that
documents the changes from the previous (minor) version.

A reference manual containing the help files (in pdf) can be 
downloaded from CRAN or from the URL given above.

All comments, criticisms and queries on the package or 
associated documentation are gratefully received.
