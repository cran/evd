CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.0-0 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  Internal change to avoid warnings under R version 1.7.0 when
  calling the multivariate asymmetric logistic distribution,
  density, quantile and generation functions.

  The tests directory has been removed.

  The evmc function unintentionally reversed asymmetric
  dependence structures. This has been fixed.  

CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.2-3 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The function fgev.quantile is now internal; the functionality
  has been absorbed into fgev.

  It is now possible to parameterize gev model fits using the
  endpoint of the distribution by setting prob to zero or one 
  in fgev.

  New functions for generating stochastic processes associated
  with extreme value theory. marma, mar and mma generate max 
  autoregressive moving average processes. evmc generates first 
  order Markov chains with bivariate extreme value dependence 
  structures.

  The functions fbvlog, fbvalog, etc are now internal. The new 
  function fbvevd should be used for the fitting of all bivariate
  models.

  The rbvevd, dbvevd and pbvevd functions replace individual 
  functions for bivariate models. Similarly, rmvevd and dmvevd 
  functions replace individual functions for multivariate models. 

  The function abvpar replaces individual functions for 
  plotting and calculating the dependence functions of 
  parametric bivariate models. 

  New functions atvnonpar and atvpar, which calculate and plot 
  dependence functions of trivariate extreme value distributions,
  using non-parametric estimates and parametric models (at given 
  parameter values).

  Fitted bivariate models (i.e. objects of class bvevd) now 
  include Akaike's Information Criterion and, optionally, 
  various dependence structure summaries. The argument dsm
  controls this option. 

  New lower.tail argument in bivariate and multivariate 
  distribution functions.

  The function pcint is now internal. Profile confidence intervals 
  are now invisibly returned from plot.profile.evd. Also, the
  argument ci of plot.profile.evd can now be a vector.

  Functions called from plot.evd (dens, pp, qq, rl) and plot.bvevd
  (bvdens, bvdp, bvcpp) are now internal.

  The default labelling of the x-axis for the return level plot 
  has been changed from the technically correct 
  "-1/log(1-1/Return Period)" to the more widely used 
  "Return Period".

  There now exists a density function for the multivariate asymmetric 
  logistic model. The density function can be calculated by calling 
  dmvevd with model = "alog".
  
  The argument mar of rmvevd, pmvevd and dmvevd can now be a list
  with d elements, where d is the dimension of the distribution.

  An extraction function logLik.evd has been added so that the 
  function AIC.default in R base can be used.

  The function profile2d.evd has a new method argument (to be
  consistent with profile.evd) and new arguments xaxs and
  yaxs (to override the default behaviour of the function image).

  The function plot.bvevd has new arguments blty (border 
  line type) and grid.

  In the function abvnonpar the logical argument convex replaces 
  the numeric argument modify.
  
  The functions fext, rext, etc are now called fextreme, 
  rextreme, etc.

  The objects formery of class "evd" are now of class 
  c("gev","evd") or c("extreme","evd"). The plot.evd function 
  is now plot.gev.

  The row names of all data.frame datasets are now the years of
  observation. Furthermore, the period of observation for the 
  venice data has been corrected in the help file.

  The arguments mesh and conf in profile.evd now work as 
  documented.
 
  The fbvall function is defunct.
  
  New datasets: failure, fox, lisbon, ocmulgee, oldage, sask  
  and uccle. 
  
  The CHANGES file has been moved to the top-level directory.


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.2-2 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  Two more datasets - venice and portpirie, intended for use
  in the evdbayes package.

  Fixed minor problem with extraction functions for bvall objects
  when only one model is fitted.

  Contours for bivariate density plots are now chosen by 
  the contour function.

  Error messages in internal functions are more informative.


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.2-1 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  New methods hall and tdo for calculating non-parametric 
  dependence function estimates.

  BUG fix: the non-parameteric dependence function estimator of 
  Caperaa et al (the default) was plotting/calculating A(1-x) 
  rather than A(x).

  The recommended citation for the package is now the article
  included in R-News Volume 2/2.

  Extra graphical arguments have been included in the abv[...]
  functions. 


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.2-0 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  The profile.evd function now has a method argument to specify 
  the optimization method. The default method is now BFGS.
  
  A BUG existed in profile.evd; a fatal error would result if 
  the mesh argument did not have a names attribute. This has 
  been fixed.

  Internal: General code cleaning/optimizing. New internal 
  functions have been created.


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.1-0 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  Class orientated objects have been introduced, including print
  methods and extraction functions.
  
  Diagnostics plots can be implemented using plot, or the lower
  level functions dens, rl, pp, qq (univariate) and bvdens, bvcpp,
  bvdp (bivariate).

  Parameters can be profiled using the functions profile and 
  profile2d. Profile deviance surfaces can be plotted using plot.
  Profile confidence intervals can be calculated using pcint.

  Fitted models can be compared using the function anova.

  New function fgev.quantile to fit the GEV distribution, 
  re-parameterizing using a quantile. This allows profile 
  deviances of extreme quantiles to be plotted.

  Extra argument corr for fitting functions.
  If corr is TRUE the correlation matrix is calculated.
  By default corr is FALSE.

  Extra argument warn.inf for fitting functions.
  When warn.inf is TRUE (the default) a warning is given if the 
  negative log-likelihood is infinite at the starting values.

  The ffrechet, fgumbel and frweibull functions are defunct.

  Internal: Function ccop for calculating conditional copulas.


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1.0-0 ARE AS FOLLOWS

  Automated starting values for fitting functions.

  Compiled code is now used within the bivariate fitting routines
  and all bivariate simulation functions.
  They are consequently much faster than those in Version 1.0-0.

  Simulation, distribution, density and fitting functions for the
  bivariate bilogistic, bivariate negative bilogistic and
  bivariate Coles-Tawn models.

  A new function fbvall which fits all bivariate models 
  simultaneously.
  For every model it returns maximum likelihood estimates, standard
  errors, criteria for model comparisons based on the deviance
  (e.g. AIC), and summaries of the dependence structure (see the 
  help file for details).

  A new function abvnonpar which calculates or plots non-parametric
  estimates of the dependence function.

  All functions explicitly allow for missing values.
  This includes bivariate fitting functions, where missing values can
  occur on either or both margins within any observation. 

  Extra argument nsloc for univariate fitting functions,
  and arguments nsloc1 and nsloc2 for bivariate fitting functions.
  These allow non-stationary fitting using linear models for the
  location parameters.

  Extra argument std.err for fitting functions.
  If std.err is FALSE the standard errors are not calculated.
  By default std.err is TRUE.

  Extra argument method for fitting functions.
  The method argument explicitly specifies the optimization method 
  to be passed to the function optim.
  The default method is now BFGS for all fitting functions except 
  fext and forder, where the default method is still Nelder-Mead.
   
  The sealevel data frame has been expanded to include observations 
  from 1912 to 1992. There are 39 missing values.  
   
  Explicit error handling in fitting functions when the observed
  information matrix is singular.  
  
  Artificial constraints are now placed on dependence parameters 
  within bivariate fitting functions to prevent numerical problems.  

  The asy argument for the bivariate asymmetric logistic and 
  bivariate asymmetric negative logistic models now defaults to
  c(1,1).

  The default values of the marginal parameters for the bivariate and
  multivariate functions in Version 1.0-0 are different.
  This is counter intuitive, so the default value for each margin
  within the multivariate functions is now c(0,1,0) (Gumbel), which 
  is consistent with the functions for bivariate models.

  The bivariate density functions contained a fairly minor BUG; if one
  of the marginal parameter arguments were passed a three column
  matrix and some of the rows of the matrix produced zero density, a
  fatal error would result. This has now been fixed.

  Internal: The .C interface is called with PACKAGE = "evd".

  Internal: R_alloc replaces malloc in C routines.
